  Cut a disciplined pub.dev release of a Dart package (or a workspace of them) —
  the consolidated genesis+lenny publishing playbook. Owns the JUDGEMENT: when a
  version is worth publishing, whether a change is a patch or a breaking minor,
  how to frame a breaking CHANGELOG + migration line, and how to reconcile a
  workspace whose tags have drifted (lenny's repo-level `v0.1.1`) onto the
  per-package `<pub-name>-v<version>` convention. The deterministic work —
  version math, tag strings, the scrub gate, the dry-run, the pub.dev poll,
  dependency order — rides the vended `dart run bin/space.dart dart release` Command, whose
  JSON this skill PARSES. Use when the human says "release <package>", "publish
  <package> to pub.dev", "cut a release", "bump and publish", "ship the new
  version", or "reconcile the release tags".
compatibility: Requires dart + the `dart run bin/space.dart` runner, git, and pub.dev publish rights (the memento.engineering verified publisher).

# Release

Publishing is a JUDGEMENT wrapped around a deterministic core. You make the calls
a human would — is this worth a release, is it breaking, is the drift real — and
you delegate every mechanical step to the `dart run bin/space.dart dart release` Command,
which returns structured JSON you PARSE. Never eyeball a version, hand-grep for
internal refs, or read pub.dev's HTML — the Command is the substrate.

## The deterministic substrate — CALL the command, PARSE its JSON

Each op emits ONE JSON object under `--json`. Read the fields; never scrape.

- **Version + tag** — `dart run bin/space.dart dart release plan --package <name> --current <ver> --change <docs|additive|fix|breaking> --json`
  -> `{current, next, change, requiresBreakingChangelog, package, tag}`.
- **Scrub gate** — `dart run bin/space.dart dart release scrub --dir <package-dir> --json`
  -> `{root, clean, filesScanned, hits:[{file, line, text, match}]}`.
- **Publish order** — `dart run bin/space.dart dart release order --manifest <deps.json> --json`
  -> `{order:[...]}` (a `{package:[in-set deps]}` manifest in; dependency-first
  sequence out). A cycle exits non-zero with a loud message.
- **Dry-run gate** — `dart run bin/space.dart dart release dry-run --dir <package-dir> --package <name> --json`
  -> `{package, exitCode, warningCount, clean, warnings:[...]}`.
- **pub.dev poll** — `dart run bin/space.dart dart release poll --package <name> --version <ver> --json`
  -> `{package, wanted, latest, isPublished}`. ONE probe — you loop it.

## When to publish (the judgement)

- A **consumer needs the version resolvable** — a sibling wants to drop a path
  override, or a member's constraint points at an unpublished version. An
  unpublished API reachable only via path links is a bug in the release state.
- A **docs-only refresh** — pub.dev renders the README/CHANGELOG frozen into the
  archive at publish time, never GitHub, so a docs fix ships as a real version.
  Cheap and encouraged; say "Docs only, no API changes" and use `--change docs`.

If neither holds, do not cut a release — say so and stop.

## Patch vs. breaking (the call `plan` encodes)

Decide the `--change` class, then let `plan` do the math:

- **Additive API, fixes, docs -> `--change` docs/additive/fix** — a PATCH
  (`0.1.x`).
- **Breaking -> `--change breaking`** — a MINOR pre-1.0 (`0.1.x` -> `0.2.0`),
  MAJOR from 1.0. `plan` returns `requiresBreakingChangelog: true`: the CHANGELOG
  MUST lead with `Breaking:` and carry a one-line migration. pub reads `^0.1.0`
  as `>=0.1.0 <0.2.0`, so a breaking change hidden in a patch silently reaches
  every resolver — that is why breaking moves the MINOR.
- **Adding a member to an exported abstract interface is breaking** for external
  implementers, even when every in-repo handle just delegates — call it breaking.
- **Cross-package coherence:** when a sibling consumes API introduced in version
  X, tighten the sibling's constraint to `^X` in the SAME change and release in
  dependency order, so a resolved pair is always coherent.

## The gates — all mandatory, IN ORDER

Run them in sequence; a failure STOPS the release.

1. **Workspace green** — `melos run analyze`, `melos run test`, `melos run
   format` (or the repo's equivalent). A plain shell gate, not a `dart release`
   op.
2. **Scrub** — `dart run bin/space.dart dart release scrub --dir <package-dir> --json`. Read
   `clean`. If false, each `hits[]` entry names the `file`, `line`, and `match`
   to strip; fix, re-run, expect `clean: true`.
3. **No internal working docs inside the package dir** — handoffs, scratch, and
   design notes ship in the archive if they live under the package. Move them out.
4. **CHANGELOG entry + version bump, committed** — bump `pubspec.yaml` to
   `plan.next`, write the CHANGELOG entry (the `Breaking:` + migration line when
   `requiresBreakingChangelog`), and commit.
5. **Dry-run** — `dart run bin/space.dart dart release dry-run --dir <package-dir> --package
   <name> --json`. Read `clean`; treat ANY warning as a stop.

## Publishing — in dependency order

- For a MULTI-package release, resolve the order first: build a
  `{package:[deps]}` manifest and call `dart run bin/space.dart dart release order --manifest
  <file> --json`. Publish in the returned `order`. (For the actual upload,
  `melos publish --no-dry-run --yes` resolves the same order automatically.)
- `dart pub publish` from the package dir.
- **After each upload, POLL before publishing a dependent:** loop `dart run bin/space.dart
  dart release poll --package <name> --version <ver> --json` until
  `isPublished: true` (the new version lands as `latest` within a minute or two).
  Only then publish the next package.

## Post-publish

1. **Tag the release commit** with `plan.tag` (`<pub-name>-v<version>`, e.g.
   `genesis_tree-v0.1.5`) and push tags.
2. Push `main`.
3. Verify: `dart run bin/space.dart dart release poll --package <name> --version <ver> --json`
   returns `isPublished: true`, and spot-check the rendered README.

## Reconciling drift (the lenny case)

lenny ships ad hoc: REPO-level tags (`v0.1.0` / `v0.1.1`) that have DRIFTED from
the actual per-package versions (`leonard_flutter` is at `0.1.7` behind a
`v0.1.1` repo tag), with no gates and no written playbook. That repo-level tag is
the **anti-pattern** — it cannot tell which package a tag belongs to. To migrate
a workspace onto the convention:

1. For each published package, read its real `pubspec.yaml` version and compose
   the correct tag with `dart run bin/space.dart dart release plan --package <name> --current
   <ver> --change docs --json` (read `tag`).
2. Create the missing per-package tags on the commits that shipped those
   versions; leave the old repo-level tags in place (deleting shared tags
   rewrites history others may hold).
3. From here every release tags per-package via `plan.tag`, and the gates above
   apply — the drift stops accreting.

## Publisher & ownership

All members ship under the **memento.engineering** verified publisher; new
versions inherit it. A package published OUTSIDE the publisher needs a one-time
**Admin -> Transfer to Publisher** (irreversible) on its pub.dev page — a manual
step this skill flags but cannot perform.

## What you don't do here

- Invent a version, tag string, publish order, or scrub verdict by inference —
  every one is a `dart run bin/space.dart dart release` op whose JSON you PARSE.
- Publish when no consumer needs the version and it is not a docs refresh.
- Hide a breaking change in a patch, or ship a `Breaking:`-less CHANGELOG for a
  `--change breaking` release.
- Publish a dependent before `poll` returns `isPublished: true` for its
  dependency.
