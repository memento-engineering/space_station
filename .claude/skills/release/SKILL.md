  Cut a disciplined pub.dev release of a Dart package (or a workspace of them) —
  the consolidated genesis+lenny publishing playbook. Owns the JUDGEMENT: when a
  version is worth publishing, whether a change is a patch or a breaking minor,
  how to frame a breaking CHANGELOG + migration line, and how to reconcile a
  workspace whose tags have drifted (lenny's repo-level `v0.1.1`) onto the
  per-package `<pub-name>-v<version>` convention. The deterministic work —
  version math, tag strings, the scrub gate, the dry-run, the pub.dev poll,
  dependency order — rides the vended `dart run space:space dart release` Command, whose
  JSON this skill PARSES. Use when the human says "release <package>", "publish
  <package> to pub.dev", "cut a release", "bump and publish", "ship the new
  version", or "reconcile the release tags".
compatibility: Requires dart + the `dart run space:space` runner, git, and pub.dev publish rights (the memento.engineering verified publisher).

# Release

Publishing is a JUDGEMENT wrapped around a deterministic core. You make the calls
a human would — is this worth a release, is it breaking, is the drift real — and
you delegate every mechanical step to the `dart run space:space dart release` Command,
which returns structured JSON you PARSE. Never eyeball a version, hand-grep for
internal refs, or read pub.dev's HTML — the Command is the substrate.

## The deterministic substrate — CALL the command, PARSE its JSON

Each op emits ONE JSON object under `--json`. Read the fields; never scrape.

- **Version + tag** — `dart run space:space dart release plan --package <name> --current <ver> --change <docs|additive|fix|breaking|rc> --json`
  -> `{current, next, change, requiresBreakingChangelog, package, tag}`.
- **Private release tag** — `dart run space:space dart release tag --repo-dir <repo-dir> --tag <tag> --json`
  -> `{tag, created, exitCode}`.
- **Consumer validation** — `dart run space:space dart release validate-consumers --rc-tag <rc-tag> --manifest <consumers.json> --json`
  -> `{rcTag, allPassed, results:[...]}`.
- **Stable promotion** — `dart run space:space dart release promote --repo-dir <repo-dir> --stable-tag <stable-tag> --validation <validation.json> --json`
  -> `{tag, created, exitCode}`.
- **Scrub gate** — `dart run space:space dart release scrub --dir <package-dir> --json`
  -> `{root, clean, filesScanned, hits:[{file, line, text, match}]}`.
- **Publish order** — `dart run space:space dart release order --manifest <deps.json> --json`
  -> `{order:[...]}` (a `{package:[in-set deps]}` manifest in; dependency-first
  sequence out). A cycle exits non-zero with a loud message.
- **Dry-run gate** — `dart run space:space dart release dry-run --dir <package-dir> --package <name> --json`
  -> `{package, exitCode, warningCount, clean, warnings:[...]}`.
- **pub.dev poll** — `dart run space:space dart release poll --package <name> --version <ver> --json`
  -> `{package, wanted, latest, isPublished}`. ONE probe — you loop it.

## When to publish (the judgement)

- A **consumer needs the version resolvable** — a sibling wants to drop a path
  override, or a member's constraint points at an unpublished version. An
  unpublished API reachable only via path links is a bug in the release state.
- A **docs-only refresh** — pub.dev renders the README/CHANGELOG frozen into the
  archive at publish time, never GitHub, so a docs fix ships as a real version.
  Cheap and encouraged; say "Docs only, no API changes" and use `--change docs`.

If neither holds, do not cut a release — say so and stop.

## Patch vs. breaking (the call `plan` encodes)

Decide the `--change` class, then let `plan` do the math:

- **Additive API, fixes, docs -> `--change` docs/additive/fix** — a PATCH
  (`0.1.x`).
- **Breaking -> `--change rc`** — plan a MINOR pre-1.0 candidate (`0.1.x`
  -> `0.2.0-rc.1`), or a MAJOR candidate from 1.0. A BREAKING change MUST go
  rc-first; do not use `--change breaking` to cut a stable version directly.
  `plan` returns `requiresBreakingChangelog: true`: the CHANGELOG MUST lead with
  `Breaking:` and carry a one-line migration. pub reads `^0.1.0` as
  `>=0.1.0 <0.2.0`, so a breaking change hidden in a patch silently reaches
  every resolver — that is why breaking moves to the next breaking base as an
  rc before stable promotion.
- **Adding a member to an exported abstract interface is breaking** for external
  implementers, even when every in-repo handle just delegates — call it breaking.
- **Cross-package coherence:** when a sibling consumes API introduced in version
  X, tighten the sibling's constraint to `^X` in the SAME change and release in
  dependency order, so a resolved pair is always coherent.

## Pre-release (rc) publishing

Cut an rc instead of a stable release when a breaking change must be adopted by
siblings before stable is safe, when the candidate needs consumer validation in
CI, or whenever “we should not have to do a public stable release to get
development to work” describes the bind. A BREAKING change MUST go rc-first.

1. Plan the candidate with `dart run space:space dart release plan --package <name>
   --current <ver> --change rc --json`; use the returned `next` and `tag`.
2. Apply the planned version and CHANGELOG entry, pass the ordered gates below,
   commit them, then cut the candidate tag with `dart run space:space dart release tag
   --repo-dir <repo-dir> --tag <rc-tag> --json`.
3. In each consumer, opt in by changing its hosted constraint to
   `^X.Y.Z-rc.N`. Pub excludes prereleases from ordinary stable caret ranges:
   a consumer on `^0.1.x` does NOT resolve `0.2.0-rc.1`, while a consumer
   pinned to `^0.2.0-rc.1` accepts later `0.2.0` rcs and stable `0.2.0`.
   That exclusion is what lets the pub.dev candidate publish without disturbing
   stable consumers.
4. **Sibling-coherence rule:** an rc on a package forces an rc on EVERY in-repo
   sibling that depends on it. Move each dependent's constraint to the rc and
   version every package in the same release wave, even when a dependent has no
   API change of its own; otherwise the package set will not resolve. Moreover,
   `dart pub publish` REFUSES a stable package that depends on a prerelease, so
   every dependent in that closure must remain rc until the wave is promoted.
   Compute dependency order with `release order` and process the complete
   closure.
5. Publish each candidate in dependency order by PUSHING ITS TAG (one tag per
   push — see Publishing below; the publish workflow uploads via trusted
   publishing). After each tag, loop `dart run space:space dart release poll --package
   <name> --version <rc-version> --json` until `isPublished: true` before
   pushing a dependent's tag. `release poll` reads pub.dev's complete versions
   list and is the authority for prereleases (`melos publish` compares against
   latest stable and is retired for uploads).
6. Validate the candidate with `dart run space:space dart release validate-consumers
   --rc-tag <rc-tag> --manifest <consumers.json> --json`, save that ONE JSON
   object as `<validation.json>`, and require `allPassed: true`.
7. Only after every consumer passes, promote with `dart run space:space dart release
   promote --repo-dir <repo-dir> --stable-tag <stable-tag> --validation
   <validation.json> --json`. A failed validation report MUST stop promotion;
   only the promoted wave may remove the prerelease suffix and publish stable.

## The gates — all mandatory, IN ORDER

Run them in sequence; a failure STOPS the release.

1. **Workspace green** — `melos run analyze`, `melos run test`, `melos run
   format` (or the repo's equivalent). A plain shell gate, not a `dart release`
   op.
2. **Scrub** — `dart run space:space dart release scrub --dir <package-dir> --json`. Read
   `clean`. If false, each `hits[]` entry names the `file`, `line`, and `match`
   to strip; fix, re-run, expect `clean: true`.
3. **No internal working docs inside the package dir** — handoffs, scratch, and
   design notes ship in the archive if they live under the package. Move them out.
4. **CHANGELOG entry + version bump, committed** — bump `pubspec.yaml` to
   `plan.next`, write the CHANGELOG entry (the `Breaking:` + migration line when
   `requiresBreakingChangelog`), and commit.
5. **Dry-run** — `dart run space:space dart release dry-run --dir <package-dir> --package
   <name> --json`. Read `clean`; treat ANY warning as a stop. In particular,
   “N checked-in files are modified in git” means gate 4 is incomplete: COMMIT
   the version bump and CHANGELOG first, then rerun dry-run. Staging is not
   enough; this gate validates checked-in state, so gate order matters.

## Publishing — push the tag; CI publishes (trusted publishing)

**Local `dart pub publish` is RETIRED.** Each repo's
`.github/workflows/publish.yml` publishes on a per-package tag push via
pub.dev's GitHub-Actions trusted publishing (OIDC — no long-lived credential).
Every historical publish-run failure on the_grid/power_station was `Version X
already exists`: a hand-publish had beaten the tag. The tag IS the publish.
CI checkouts also carry no `pubspec_overrides.yaml`, so the move-the-overrides
dance disappears with the hand-publish.

1. Land the release commit through the repo's normal PR path (queue where one
   exists). Tags point at the MERGED main commit.
2. Resolve dependency order (`dart run space:space dart release order --manifest <file>
   --json` for a multi-package wave).
3. For each package in that order:
   - `git tag <plan.tag> <release-commit> && git push origin <plan.tag>` —
     **ONE TAG PER PUSH.** GitHub fires NO workflows for a push containing more
     than three tags (observed live 2026-08-23: four tags in one push, zero
     runs), and per-tag pushes are what give you ordering anyway.
   - Watch the run (`gh run list --workflow=publish.yml`) and loop `dart run space:space
     dart release poll --package <name> --version <ver> --json` until
     `isPublished: true`. Only then push the DEPENDENT's tag.
4. **First release of a package:** automated publishing must be enabled ONCE on
   the package's pub.dev admin page (Automated publishing → GitHub Actions →
   repository `memento-engineering/<repo>`, tag pattern: `<package>-v`
   immediately followed by pub.dev's version placeholder — the word `version`
   in double curly braces, as the admin form suggests). Only an uploader can
   click it — a publish run
   failing with an authorization/OIDC message means exactly this toggle; hand
   the human the admin URL, nothing else.
   (`melos publish` remains retired for uploads; melos still owns the
   workspace-green gates.)

## Post-publish

1. Verify: `dart run space:space dart release poll --package <name> --version <ver>
   --json` returns `isPublished: true` for every wave member, and spot-check
   the rendered README.
2. Pull `main` in the primary checkout so the local tree matches the tagged
   release.

## Reconciling drift (the lenny case)

lenny ships ad hoc: REPO-level tags (`v0.1.0` / `v0.1.1`) that have DRIFTED from
the actual per-package versions (`leonard_flutter` is at `0.1.7` behind a
`v0.1.1` repo tag), with no gates and no written playbook. That repo-level tag is
the **anti-pattern** — it cannot tell which package a tag belongs to. To migrate
a workspace onto the convention:

1. For each published package, read its real `pubspec.yaml` version and compose
   the correct tag with `dart run space:space dart release plan --package <name> --current
   <ver> --change docs --json` (read `tag`).
2. Create the missing per-package tags on the commits that shipped those
   versions; leave the old repo-level tags in place (deleting shared tags
   rewrites history others may hold).
3. From here every release tags per-package via `plan.tag`, and the gates above
   apply — the drift stops accreting.

## Publisher & ownership

All members ship under the **memento.engineering** verified publisher; new
versions inherit it. A package published OUTSIDE the publisher needs a one-time
**Admin -> Transfer to Publisher** (irreversible) on its pub.dev page — a manual
step this skill flags but cannot perform.

## What you don't do here

- Invent a version, tag string, publish order, or scrub verdict by inference —
  every one is a `dart run space:space dart release` op whose JSON you PARSE.
- Publish when no consumer needs the version and it is not a docs refresh.
- Hide a breaking change in a patch, or ship a `Breaking:`-less CHANGELOG for a
  `--change breaking` release.
- Publish a dependent before `poll` returns `isPublished: true` for its
  dependency.
