  Write the seat's own handoff onto its Agent Disc, bank the durable learnings,
  and tell the OUTER harness what to do next — never compact or clear blind.
  One ritual, two requesters: the HUMAN types /handoff [slug], or the AGENT
  self-initiates at a boundary (a long context, a natural task end, before a
  bounce or a harness upgrade, or when told "take a beat, then hand off"). Use
  before compaction, clear, or relaunch — and use its Resume section as the
  SUCCESSOR, which consumes the newest handoff through the `succession` verb.
compatibility: >
  Requires a seat whose Agent Disc is `<grid home>/.grid/seats/<seat>/`, the
  `dart run space:space` runner, bd (beads CLI), and git.

# Handoff

The auto-summarizer guesses what mattered. You KNOW. However the event was
raised, it ends the same way: a curated note on your seat's disc, durable
learnings banked separately, and ONE line telling the outer harness what to do
next.

A handoff is WORKING MEMORY — a hypertemporal artifact that lives exactly one
succession. It is a disc note of `kind: handoff`, and its file shape, its home,
its index line and the delete-on-consume rule are all fixed by
`the_grid#agent-disc-file-shape-and-home`.
This skill invents no shape. A handoff never graduates, and never goes near a
decisions register.

## 1. SETTLE

Before you write a word:

- Finish or park every in-flight tool call. Nothing half-written — no dangling
  `bd` write, no half-applied edit, no unpushed commit the human does not know
  about.
- NAME every resource this seat owns: worktrees, branches, locks, the resident
  process, open PRs. The successor inherits them and cannot see them.

## 2. WRITE the handoff onto the disc

One file, on your own seat's disc:

```
<grid home>/.grid/seats/<seat>/handoff-<utc-stamp>-<slug>.md
```

`<utc-stamp>` is `date -u +%Y%m%dt%H%M%Sz` — kebab-safe, and it sorts.
`<slug>` is the human's argument, or three kebab words naming the thread.

The front matter is the disc's. No new keys:

```yaml
---
name: handoff-20260903t141200z-acp-thread
description: <one line; this is the recall key>
seat: <seat>
date: <YYYY-MM-DD, UTC>
kind: handoff
---
```

Then these TEN sections, in this order. Each one earned its place in a
successor's wasted hour:

1. **Header** — seat, the stamp in UTC **and** local (the CDT skew has caused
   misreads), harness + model, the trigger (human `/handoff` or
   agent-initiated, with the reason), and one sentence: what the successor is
   being brought back to do.
2. **Rulings** — what the human decided this session, and WHERE each one is
   encoded: bead id WITH its title, dep edge, register entry (slug and title),
   disc note. A ruling recorded
   nowhere else dies with this file.
3. **Board state** — a table of ids by store with state, ONE line each, and
   the bead TITLE next to every id (`lenny-96sa — leonard_grid_assets: convert
   the sample suite …`), never the id or slug alone: the successor and the
   human read this on a phone and cannot open a store to decode an id. Gates
   name the bead they block by id and title; decisions name the entry title
   next to the slug. Read it, never remember it:
   `dart run space:space status --state-workspace <grid home>`, then
   `bd -C <store root> list --status=in_progress`.

   Before writing `empty by design`, repeat the Sweep enumeration for every
   stamped-but-unmounted bead across both blocker sources and inspect each
   open blocker's type and notes. The board is empty by design only when that
   OPEN-blocker enumeration is empty; otherwise record every blocker, putting
   each release node or explicit agent-executes blocker in a **GOVERNOR WORK**
   row with its id, title, owning store, and next executable action, and only
   genuine human blockers in human-gate rows.
4. **In flight** — what is hot and why, plus the resources SETTLE named: the
   resident, locks, worktrees, PRs waiting on a queue.
5. **Tried and failed — do not retry** — each with the reason it failed.
6. **Promises to the human** — and the status of each.
7. **Context the successor must not re-derive** — the expensive facts, with
   their receipts.
8. **Unfiled observations** — what the human said to ignore, recorded here and
   nowhere else.
9. **Resume here** — ordered steps; step 1 is executable VERBATIM.
10. **Ready** — the disc notes banked this session, by name, and an attestation
    that nothing is half-written.

## 3. BANK the durable learnings

A fact that outlives one succession is not a handoff section — it is its own
disc note (`kind: lesson`, `kind: receipt`, or `kind: observation`), one fact
per file, in the same front matter. Write those FIRST, then name them in
**Ready**.
Never bank by pasting the handoff: the handoff is deleted on consume, so a
fact that lives only inside it dies with it.

## 4. INDEX it

Add ONE pointer line to `<grid home>/.grid/seats/<seat>/MEMORY.md`:

```
- [Handoff <stamp> — <slug>](handoff-<utc-stamp>-<slug>.md) — <hook>
```

The harness loads that index at session start, so a successor finds the
handoff even where no hook is installed.

## 5. SIGNAL the outer harness — one line, then end the turn

You cannot compact, clear, or restart yourself in any harness we run. The
signal goes UP. End the turn with exactly ONE of these lines, and say nothing
after it:

- **(a) Continue in place** — `Handoff written: <path>. Run /compact now — the handoff complements the summary, it does not replace it.`
- **(b) Fresh start** — `Handoff written: <path>. Run /clear, or exit and let the seat launcher relaunch this seat.`
- **(c) Headless / launcher-driven** — `Handoff written: <path>. Turn ended for relaunch.`
  The launcher brings the seat back primed with it
  (`claude --append-system-prompt-file <path>`). WHICH run mode it relaunches
  into is the launcher's business, not this skill's.

The launcher itself, and the `SessionStart` compact-matcher hook that
references the newest handoff after an in-place compaction, are the
prime/launcher bead's deliverable — not this skill's. This skill writes the
file and says the line.

There is no `PreCompact` guard and no archive directory.

## Resume — the successor's side of the same ritual

You are the successor. Before you sweep, before you plan:

1. Resolve the handoff and ARCHIVE the disc, destroying nothing:

   ```
   dart run space:space succession <seat> --grid-home "<grid home>" --no-destructive
   ```

   `NO HANDOFF` ends the resume — there is nothing to consume. `REFUSED` is
   shown to the human exactly as it reads, and neither note is touched.
   `WOULD DELETE <path>` names the one note to read.

2. Read that note and act on its **Resume here**, starting at step 1 verbatim.

3. CONSUME it, in the SAME turn that read it:

   ```
   dart run space:space succession <seat> --grid-home "<grid home>"
   ```

   This second call resolves the disc again, commits whatever disc changes the
   turn made, verifies the note is in `HEAD`, and only then removes the file
   and its one `MEMORY.md` pointer line. The commit is what earns the
   deletion: a disc that was never committed has no history to consume into.

`--no-destructive` is the safe first run on an unfamiliar disc — it does
everything except the deletion, so a refusal surfaces before anything is lost.
Two live handoffs ALWAYS refuse, in either form, and the verb names both: two
on one disc mean a succession was skipped, only the newest describes the
board, and which one that is stays a human's call.
