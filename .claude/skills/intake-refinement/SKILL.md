# Intake refinement

A resident station's drive set IS the ready frontier: **ready = in**. Refinement
is the only gate between a bead and a live agent, so every rule here exists
because its violation put a real agent on wrong work.

## The bead contract

Every bead intended for the station needs:

1. **A driveable type** — only `task`, `bug`, `feature`, `chore` mount.
   `epic`/`decision`/`spike`/`story`/`milestone` are organizational and are
   correctly ignored by the mount boundary (they still show in `ready`).
2. **`validation_plan` metadata** — a real `sh` command, run from the bead's
   worktree root by the review committee's gating lane:

   ```
   bd -C <work repo> update <bead> --set-metadata \
     'validation_plan=cd packages/<pkg> && dart pub get && dart analyze && dart test' \
     --actor operator
   ```

   A plan-less bead grades **F by design** (the gating lane runs `false`) and
   hard-blocks at review. `dart pub get` first — worktrees start unresolved.
   Scope it by **Scope the validation_plan to every consumer** below.
3. **Acceptance criteria** — at least one `- [ ]` checkbox a named command can
   falsify: `bd -C <work repo> update <bead> --acceptance '- [ ] <outcome>'
   --actor operator`.
4. **Deps wired the right way round** — every blocker NAMED in the description
   and WIRED. See **Wire every dependency at intake**.
5. **A description an agent can act on alone** — the agent receives the bead
   text and a worktree, nothing else. Name packages and acceptance shape.

Rows 1–4 are exactly the four rows the `filing` verb checks; row 5 is the
judgement this skill's reader owns. Never re-derive rows 1–4 by reading the
bead — run the verb (**The exit check**).

## Search prior art BEFORE accepting a filing

Before accepting any new filing, search the org backlog for the work already
being tracked, from the grid home:

```bash
dart run space:space search --json "<token>"
```

Query **single tokens** (`filing`, `refiner`, `overlay`), one call per token.
The lexical leg ANDs a multi-word query, so a two-word query is the reliable
way to MISS the duplicate. Read `hitCount` and each store's `outcome`; a real
duplicate is closed against the survivor with receipts, and a near-miss is
wired as a dependency instead of re-filed.

**Why:** filing a second bead for work an open sibling already owns spends a
full agent round producing a colliding branch, and the coherence lane grades
the second bead F for duplicating its sibling.

## Scope the validation_plan to every consumer

The plan runs every package the CHANGE reaches, not just the packages the diff
edits. A changed public API in `packages/<a>` that `packages/<b>` imports means
BOTH packages are in the plan:

```
validation_plan=cd packages/<a> && dart pub get && dart analyze && dart test && cd ../<b> && dart pub get && dart analyze && dart test
```

**Why:** a plan scoped to the diff's own package goes green while the consumer
no longer compiles; the break surfaces at the NEXT bead's `pub get`, after the
PR merged.

## Wire every dependency at intake

- **Local (same store)** — name each blocker on its own `Blocked by:` or
  `Depends on:` description line, then wire it:

  ```bash
  bd -C <store root> dep add <blocked bead> <blocker bead> --actor operator
  ```

  The BLOCKED bead is the first argument. The `filing` verb's `dependencies`
  row reads the ids named in the description and fails until each one has an
  outgoing `blocks` edge.
- **Cross-store** — never a local dependency row, and never
  `bd dep add <id> external:<project>:<id>`: mint an OPEN grid-state
  `type=link` bead with the station's link verb, arming BOTH endpoint
  prefixes:

  ```bash
  dart run space:space link <blocked bead> --blocked-by <blocker bead> \
    --prefix <blocked bead prefix> --prefix <blocker bead prefix> \
    --actor operator --reason "<why this ordering exists>"
  ```

  The link bead carries `grid.link.from`, `grid.link.to` and
  `grid.link.type=blocks`; the station projects it and the shared block guard
  enforces it. A malformed link fails closed. `dart run space:space link ls` lists what
  is wired.

**Why:** an unwired blocker leaves the blocked bead in `ready`, so the station
mounts it and its agent builds against an API the blocker has not shipped. A
raw foreign-id dependency row is worse: `bd doctor --fix` can classify it as
orphaned and sever it silently.

## FLAG an EITHER/OR fork — never decide it

When refinement finds two viable designs, write BOTH into the bead as a named
fork and stop:

```
FORK (author decides): (A) extend the existing service with a second mode, or
(B) mint a sibling service. NOT decided at intake.
```

Do not pick, and do not approve the bead until a human picks.

**Why:** a fork settled at intake by inference reaches the build stage looking
decided; the round is spent before the human ever sees that there was a choice.

## Stamp architecture constraints into the CHILD bead

An agent reads ONE bead: its own. A constraint recorded only in a parent epic —
the seam to extend, the package that owns the surface, the doctrine that binds
— does not exist for the child's agent. Copy every constraint that governs the
child INTO the child's own description.

**Why:** the epic said "extend the existing loader", the child said "add a
loader", the agent built a second loader, and the coherence lane graded it F.

## Repo-relative paths in every declared test list

Every path a bead names is written relative to the REPO ROOT —
`packages/grid_assets/test/assets/skill_assets_test.dart`, never a bare
`test/assets/skill_assets_test.dart` and never an absolute machine path.

**Why:** the agent's cwd is a fresh worktree root, so a bare path resolves
under whichever package it happened to enter; the declared test is "not found"
and the criterion goes unchecked.

## Point at the primitive that already exists

When the work extends something the tree already owns, write the pointer into
the bead body as `path:line` plus the relationship:

```
COMPOSE: packages/grid_assets/lib/src/filing/filing_contract.dart:139 owns the
four-row completeness contract — CALL it; do not add a second predicate.
```

**Why:** without the pointer the build stage re-expresses the primitive beside
the one that exists. That is the duplication the coherence lane F-grades, and
it is why this skill CALLS the `filing` verb instead of carrying a completeness
checker of its own.

## The exit check — `filing` is the oracle, and it is a COMMAND

Refinement EXITS on the verb, never on a reading. From the owning store root:

```bash
dart run space:space filing --json "<bead>"
```

The report is one JSON object: `{id, passed, requirements, error?}`.
`requirements` carries exactly four rows, in order — `driveable_type`,
`validation_plan`, `acceptance_criteria`, `dependencies` — each
`{requirement, passed, detail}`. `passed` is true only for a found bead whose
four rows ALL pass.

For every row reporting `"passed": false`, apply its `detail` as the
correction:

- `<type> is not driveable` — re-type the bead to `task`/`bug`/`feature`/
  `chore`, or re-home the work under a driveable child.
- `validation_plan is blank` — author one, scoped by **Scope the
  validation_plan to every consumer**.
- `acceptance_criteria is blank` — author `- [ ]` checkboxes a named command
  can falsify.
- `missing outgoing blocks edges: <ids>` — wire each named id per **Wire every
  dependency at intake**.

Then RERUN the verb. Repeat until the report reads `"passed": true`; only then
stage the bead for approval. Nothing else stages a bead — a reading of the
fields is not the check, and this skill deliberately owns no completeness
predicate of its own.

A report carrying `error` (`bead not found`) is a REFUSAL, not a pass: the id
is wrong or the cwd is the wrong store. Correct the id or the store root and
rerun. Never approve past an `error`.

## Staging: approve with the approve verb, only after refinement

Drafts are created open without `grid.approved`; the human's approval is the
approve verb, which re-runs the same four-row filing preflight and then writes
the label AND its stamp in one `bd update`. Against a LIVE station, the
mounted predicate refuses any bead missing the label, and refuses a
hand-added, unstamped one with
`approval: unstamped label - approve with the approve verb`, so the mount race
is closed without a timer:

- Create without `grid.approved`, wire deps, finish the description and design,
  and drive `dart run space:space filing --json "<bead>"` to `"passed": true`. Only after
  human approval, from the owning store root, run:

  ```
  dart run space:space approve --actor operator --json "<bead>"
  ```

  The verb stamps `grid.approved_by` (the `--actor`), `grid.approved_at` (the
  UTC ISO-8601 instant) and `grid.approved_rev` (the store root's git HEAD sha)
  beside the label; that one stamped write is the final transition into the
  mounted frontier. A refusal writes nothing — it reports `"approved": false`
  with a `reason` plus the failing filing rows; fix them and rerun the verb.
- Removing `grid.approved` from a bead that is ALREADY mounted does not evict it
  — mounted work is never evicted for budget or readiness reasons; only a
  positive terminal (bead closed / session terminal) unmounts.

## Staleness reconciliation — run BEFORE arming any store

Backlogs rot: features get built in other sessions and the beads stay open. A
stale bead costs a full agent round on already-shipped work, and (until the
committee's diff-pinning fix is everywhere) can even come back A-graded because
critics reviewed the mainline code as if it were the bead's diff.

For each ready bead: check whether the named artifact already exists in the
work repo's mainline (`git log`/`grep` for the package, class, or file the bead
names). If shipped, CLOSE IT AS STALE WITH RECEIPTS — the reason carries the
file paths and commit ids that prove it:

```bash
bd -C <work repo> close <bead> --reason "<receipts: file paths, commit ids>" \
  --actor operator
```

Closing a bead with a live agent on it is safe — that is the designed positive-
terminal unmount.

## Re-homing beads across stores

Re-creating a bead in another store carries the text, NOT the metadata:
re-stamp `validation_plan` (and any `grid.*` envelope keys) on the destination
or round 1 gates F. Re-run the exit check in the DESTINATION store before
staging.

## bd footguns

- `bd update` with an EMPTY id resolves the LAST-TOUCHED bead — never
  interpolate a possibly-empty variable into an id slot.
- Writes route by CWD: always `bd -C <store-root>` (a leading `cd` in a
  compound also re-routes the command through permission classifiers).
- `bd create --deps 'blocks:X'` makes the NEW bead block X (inverted from the
  common intent) — wire with `bd dep add` after creating.
- Grouped mutations: `bd batch` (one transaction). Bulk reads: `bd export`.
  Never `bd show` from a polling path; never spawn bd per issue in a loop.
- `--actor operator` on every mutation; reasons carry receipts.
